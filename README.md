# APS Failure Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model for detecting component failures in the Air Pressure System (APS) of trucks. The APS is critical for various functions such as braking and gear changes. Detecting failures early in this system can prevent unnecessary repairs and reduce maintenance costs.

## Problem Statement
The dataset consists of sensor data collected from trucks. The positive class in this dataset represents failures in a specific component of the APS. The negative class refers to failures in other components not related to APS. The challenge is to reduce the cost associated with unnecessary repairs by minimizing false predictions of APS failures.

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that can:

Accurately predict APS failures.
Reduce false positives (where APS failure is predicted but does not occur).
Improve overall maintenance efficiency by reducing the cost of unnecessary repairs.
